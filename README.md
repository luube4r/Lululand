# Lululand

## Overview  
**Lululand** is a virtual internal network created to serve as a hands-on learning and testing environment for cybersecurity concepts and techniques. Developed as part of my journey as a Network Security major, Lululand allows me to apply and refine the knowledge and skills I acquire throughout my studies and career.  

The network operates within Oracle VM VirtualBox and is designed to facilitate experimentation, testing, and practice. Lululand is equipped with:  
- An **OPNsense firewall** with IDS/IPS capabilities.  
- Three internal virtual machines:  
  - **Kali Linux** for offensive security testing.  
  - **Ubuntu** for server or application hosting.  
  - **Windows 10** for endpoint simulation and analysis.  

## Project Goals  
The primary goals of Lululand include:  
1. **Penetration Testing**: Conducting simulated cyberattacks using an external virtual machine as a malicious actor to:  
   - Analyze traffic flows within the network.  
   - Identify vulnerabilities and areas of weakness.  
   - Develop threat intelligence and mitigation strategies.  

2. **Service Expansion**:  
   - Implementing additional services such as a web server for hosting or application testing.  

3. **Skill Enhancement**: Refining my abilities in network monitoring, intrusion detection, and secure system design.  

## Future Plans  
In addition to the current setup, I aim to:  
- Introduce additional virtual machines and services.  
- Configure advanced monitoring tools and logging mechanisms.  
- Automate threat detection and response processes using scripts and open-source tools.  

## Technical Setup  
- **Virtualization Platform**: Oracle VM VirtualBox
- **Firewall**: OPNsense Firewall
- **Internal Machines**:  
  - Kali GNU/Linux
  - Ubuntu
  - Windows 10  

## How to Use  
Coming soon: Step-by-step instructions for replicating the Lululand network, including configurations for OPNsense and virtual machines.  
1. Install the latest version of **Oracle VirtualBox** or any type 2 hypervisor that you're familiar with
   - **VirtualBox Download Page**: https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html#vbox
2. Download the latest ISO images for the OPNsense Firewall, and the Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows 10/11 machines.
